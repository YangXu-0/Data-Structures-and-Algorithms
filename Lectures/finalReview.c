Things to Memorize:


Notes:
- Always use unsigned ints
- Unsigned ints are NOT 8 bits
- Can use shifting as a tracker
- For overwriting, can return overwritten value
- Should probably set iteration limit for open addressing (insert and search)
- Be careful when allocation memory, use sizeof!!
- Remember realloc inefficiency

Things to Practice:
- Binary trees
- Heaps
- AVL trees
- Graphs
- Adder circuits
- Hash tables
